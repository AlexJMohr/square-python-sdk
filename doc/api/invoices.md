use in a subsequent request to retrieve the next set of invoices.

```python
def list_invoices(self,
                 location_id,
                 cursor=None,
                 limit=None)
```

|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `location_id` | `str` | Query, Required | The ID of the location for which to list invoices. |
| `cursor` | `str` | Query, Optional | A pagination cursor returned by a previous call to this endpoint.<br>Provide this cursor to retrieve the next set of results for your original query.<br><br>For more information, see [Pagination](https://developer.squareup.com/docs/build-basics/common-api-patterns/pagination). |
| `limit` | `int` | Query, Optional | The maximum number of invoices to return (200 is the maximum `limit`).<br>If not provided, the server uses a default limit of 100 invoices. |

## Response Type

This method returns a `ApiResponse` instance. The `body` property of this instance returns the response data which is of type [`List Invoices Response`](../../doc/models/list-invoices-response.md).

location_id = 'location_id4'

result = invoices_api.list_invoices(location_id)

    print(result.errors)
```


# Create Invoice

Creates a draft [invoice](../../doc/models/invoice.md)

```python
def create_invoice(self,
                  body)
```

invoice (you cannot delete a published invoice, including one that is scheduled for processing).

# Update Invoice

Updates an invoice by modifying fields, clearing fields, or both. For most updates, you can use a sparse
`Invoice` object to add fields or change values and use the `fields_to_clear` field to specify fields to clear.
However, some restrictions apply. For example, you cannot change the `order_id` or `location_id` field and you
must provide the complete `custom_fields` list to update a custom field. Published invoices have additional restrictions.

```python
def update_invoice(self,
                  invoice_id,
                  body)
```

}

result = invoices_api.cancel_invoice(
    invoice_id,
    body
)
print(result)

if result.is_success():
    print(result.body)
elif result.is_error():
    print(result.errors)
```


# Publish Invoice

Publishes the specified draft invoice.

After an invoice is published, Square
follows up based on the invoice configuration. For example, Square
sends the invoice to the customer's email address, charges the customer's card on file, or does
nothing. Square also makes the invoice available on a Square-hosted invoice page.

The invoice `status` also changes from `DRAFT` to a status
based on the invoice configuration. For example, the status changes to `UNPAID` if
Square emails the invoice or `PARTIALLY_PAID` if Square charge a card on file for a portion of the
invoice amount.

```python
def publish_invoice(self,
                   invoice_id,
                   body)
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Tags | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `invoice_id` | `str` | Template, Required | The ID of the invoice to publish. |
| `body` | [`Publish Invoice Request`](../../doc/models/publish-invoice-request.md) | Body, Required | An object containing the fields to POST for the request.<br><br>See the corresponding object definition for field details. |

## Response Type

This method returns a `ApiResponse` instance. The `body` property of this instance returns the response data which is of type [`Publish Invoice Response`](../../doc/models/publish-invoice-response.md).

## Example Usage

invoice_id = 'invoice_id0'

body = {
    'version': 1,
    'idempotency_key': '32da42d0-1997-41b0-826b-f09464fc2c2e'
